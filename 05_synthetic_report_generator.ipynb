Sequences included: T1-weighted pre- and post-contrast, T2-weighted, FLAIR, DWI and ADC sequences.  Slice thickness was 3mm for all sequences.  IV Gadolinium contrast (Gadobutrol) was administered at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg.\n",

The lesion demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement following contrast administration. Surrounding the lesion is mild T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity, suggestive of edema. There is associated mass effect, with mild effacement of the ipsilateral temporal horn of the lateral ventricle and slight midline shift to the left, measuring approximately 2mm. No other enhancing lesions are identified.  No evidence of acute hemorrhage is seen on DWI and ADC sequences. The ventricles and sulcal spaces are otherwise within normal limits for age.  The visualized posterior fossa structures demonstrate normal morphology. The orbits and visualized sinuses appear unremarkable.\n",
